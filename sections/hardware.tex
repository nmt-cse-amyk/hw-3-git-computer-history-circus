Analog computers are used by using the similarities of mathematics small-scale properties. 
These properties include things such as wheel motions, voltage and current current of electrical components, and other mathematical physical phenomena. These computers model physical phenomena voltage and current as analog quantities. 
These analog systems create a electrical analog of other systems. These help the user of the computer to predict how a system of interest will behave. 
Many of these computers worked by using moving parts while in the current age of computers are all digital.\cite{knuthwebsite}
