The software industry is one of the largest and most influential industries in the world in this time period. It began as early as 1830s with Charles Babbageâ€˜s Analytical Engine, but was actually established in the late 1950s, when the use of computers for business applications expanded rapidly creating a huge demand for the people that had some programming experience and knowledge. Gradually the entrepreneurial computer software and services companies of the 1950s and 1960s, grew dramatically through the 1970s and 1980s and became a market force, making some competetion for the computer hardware companies.
