By the turn of the century, conflict was beginning to rile up across the world. Within the 1910s and 1940s, two world wars were sparked within
Europe and the surrounding seas, employing new weaponry and technologies never before seen. With the advent of rockets and airplanes capable of dropping bombs,
communication between generals, platoons, armies were critical to computing victories. A secured network had to be built where parties could communicate,
while being secured enough where the enemy could not peer in. Thus, living computer humans were brought in to design the first major cryptography breakthroughs in Germany,
which eventually led to the first analog machines being used for war\cite{cmphistory}.
