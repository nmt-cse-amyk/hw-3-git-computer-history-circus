Analog computers were the earliest versions of computers, using hydraulics, mechanics, or electricity in order to transmit information and perform calculations. They are significantly
slower than today's digital computers by a magnitude of several thousands, but were critical for calculations and cryptography used in both world wars and other applications.
We believe that in order to understand the early evolution of digital computers, which emerged during the 1960s-70s, we must analyze the analog computers that originated
during the first half of the 20th century.
